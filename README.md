# 2-out-of-3-visual-cryptography
2 out of 3 scheme n = 3, which means this scheme generates three shares. The three shares (binary images) consist of exactly three pixels for each pixel in the secret image; every secret pixel of the image is converted into three shares. But we need two shares to recover the secret image by superimposing the two shared images.
